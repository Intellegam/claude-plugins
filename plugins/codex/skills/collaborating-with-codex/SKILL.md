description: This skill should be used when working on architectural decisions, complex refactoring, system design, API redesign, or multi-component implementations. Also use when asked to "consult codex", "get a second opinion", "validate this plan", or "have codex review". Guides proactive collaboration with OpenAI Codex for brainstorming, plan validation, and code review.

# Codex Collaboration Guidelines

Use OpenAI Codex as a collaborative sub-agent for brainstorming, plan validation, and code review. Treat output as a second opinion—critically evaluate, don't blindly accept.

## Tools

- `codex` — Start new session (defaults to read-only sandbox)
- `codex-reply` — Continue session with prior context
- `codex-review` — Dedicated review mode (requires `mode` parameter)

### codex-review modes and parameters

| mode          | required params         | example                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `uncommitted` | _(none)_                | `mode: "uncommitted"`                               |
| `base`        | `base` (branch name)    | `mode: "base", base: "main"`                        |
| `commit`      | `commit` (SHA)          | `mode: "commit", commit: "abc123"`                  |
| `custom`      | `prompt` (instructions) | `mode: "custom", prompt: "Focus on error handling"` |

All modes accept an optional `cwd` parameter for the repo root.

## When to Use

- Complex decisions where a second perspective adds value
- Architectural validation before implementation
- Plan validation before presenting to user
- Code review after significant changes

## When NOT to Use

- Simple, straightforward tasks
- Time-sensitive operations where latency matters
- Trivial changes that don't warrant discussion

## Guidelines

- **Form your own analysis first** to ensure independent perspectives—avoid anchoring bias
- Prompt specifically with context (like any sub-agent)
- Sessions run in read-only sandbox mode
- Use `codex-reply` for multi-turn discussions or reviews needing prior context
- Synthesize conclusions—don't just relay raw Codex output
- When developing plans (yourself or via Plan sub-agent), validate with Codex before presenting to user
